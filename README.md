# The Relax Switch

The Relax Switch is a fun little device that plays [pure
moods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Moods) when someone turns on a light
switchâ€”perfect for surprising your guests when they walk into the bathroom. It
runs on a Raspberry Pi using [gokrazy](https://gokrazy.org/quickstart/), a
minimal Go-based operating system that turns your Pi into a single-purpose
appliance. This makes the device lightweight, secure, and easy to update over
the network.
